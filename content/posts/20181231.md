On New Year's Eve of 2018, I decided to use Git to handle all my (non-private) note-keeping. My GitHub space was looking neglected (mainly because I rarely make my projects public) so I decided to freshen it up by using it to keep track of all my notes. There was another reason... I've been hankering to try [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) out. I don't remember where I read about Hugo but it was around the same time I found out about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Hugo claims to be "the world's fastest framework for building websites" and... it is.

### The Gist
The day actually began with some Git-related housekeeping activities, which I'll detail in tomorrow's post, but I wanted to test the whole site generation and deployment first (so I could start writing down what I did).

:bell: I used Linux today. :bell:

Instead of using __apt__ to install __hugo__, I downloaded the latest release from its GitHub project site:

```bash
# download the latest version, which at this time is v0.53
wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.53/hugo_0.53_Linux-64bit.deb

# install
sudo dpkg -i hugo_0.53_Linux-64bit.deb
```

Next, I followed (most of) the steps on Hugo's [Quick Start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) page. The only difference is the theme I chose. Instead of __ananke__, I went with [__Code Editor__](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-code-editor-theme/) because it reminded me of the Pip-Boy layout from [_Fallout_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)) even though it was really inspired by the Atom editor design. In case I needed to customise it, I forked the repository from https://github.com/aubm/hugo-code-editor-theme.git before adding the new fork as a submodule:

```bash
git submodule add git@github.com:macleinn/hugo-code-editor-theme.git themes/code-editor
```

As an appendix to my Hugo chapter, I decided to start my GitHub User Page at https://macleinn.github.io and host the generated content from the Hugo project. Again, I followed the steps provided by Hugo. The only change I made to the steps on [GitHub hosting](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) was a tiny one (and suggested by a comment in the provided code). The change is in __deploy.sh__ script, which has been committed.

The whole experiment took no more than 2 hours, including the time spent on choosing a theme.

### Notes
* After cloning the project to a new workspace, the Git submodules (__themes/code-editor__ and __public__) need to be re-initialised. This can be done like so:

    ```bash
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

    I actually have to learn a bit more about Git submodules because I had to [stackoverflow that one](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1030169/easy-way-to-pull-latest-of-all-git-submodules).

* Additionally, in the __public__ (git submodule) directory, I had to update the HEAD position to the master branch so that I can push new updates:
    ```bash
    git checkout master
    ```
