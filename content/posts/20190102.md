Part of the learning process is memorising. Whether it's an artistic or scientific discipline, practice reinforces memory and strengthens understanding. Dance choreography, for example, requires practice to commit movements into muscle memory before it can be performed with precision and emotions.[^1] For some reason, I thought it'd be fun to learn CSS3 animation by showing dancer positions in [Regency dances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regency_dance). It's going to take me a while to take it to demo level so this will be covered over multiple entries.

### The Gist
To keep track of my progress, I created a new GitHub project called [Cotillion](https://github.com/macleinn/cotillion), named after the French country dance.

Today, I started with something fairly simple. I drew a shape with a number in it and made it move in a prescribed path over and over again. The path movement was inspired by [this CSS-Tricks page](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/o/offset-path/).
